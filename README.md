TensorFlow: Open-source framework for machine learning and deep learning.
Keras: Simplifies building, training, and evaluating CNN models (integrated with TensorFlow).
2. Pandas and NumPy ðŸ“ˆ
Pandas: For data manipulation and organization.
NumPy: For numerical operations, arrays, and matrices.
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn ðŸ“Š
Matplotlib: Visualizes data and tracks model training.
Seaborn: High-level statistical visualizations (e.g., heatmaps).
4. Scikit-learn ðŸ§ 
Scikit-learn: Used for dataset splitting, performance metrics, and confusion matrix generation.
5. Image Processing ðŸ–¼
PIL: For image data manipulation (opening, modifying, saving).
ImageDataGenerator: Performs real-time data augmentation to prevent overfitting.
